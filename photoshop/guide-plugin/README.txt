GuideGuide supports Photoshop CC and later.

1. Launch the version of Photoshop into which you would like to install GuideGuide. If you are on Windows, you will need to launch Photoshop as administrator.
2. Go to File > Scripts > Browse, then navigate to installer.jsx in the unzipped GuideGuide folder. A message will pop up telling you that GuideGuide has been installed.
3. Restart Photoshop. You will find GuideGuide at Window > Extensions > GuideGuide

That's it!

If for some reason this doesn't work, you can find the most up-to-date
